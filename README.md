# AdLinkr
A URL Shortener for Digital Marketers

## Motive

While looking for URL shortening tools for my own day job as a Technical Digital Strategist, I found
that the large majority of URL shortening tools with an emphasis on digital marketing and analytics
were proprietary SaaS products and others seemed to fall a little short of my persona wishlist. AdLinkr
hopes to be an answer for digital marketers looking to be able to own and manage their own completely
open solution.
